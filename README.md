# Discord bot sample on discord.py
This is a simple bot for your discord servers managed by cogs (modules).

A preinstalled Filter module allows you to manage messages filter for specific servers.
Every server (guild) has its own messages filter and will delete the forbidden words if the author doesn't have the `Manage Messages` permission for this server.
Only members with `Manage Messages` permission can edit the filter.

You can add your modules if you want.
On how to use and build cogs you can find in the [docs for discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ext/commands/cogs.html#quick-example).
